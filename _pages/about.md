I’m a third-year PhD Candidate at UC Irvine, advised by [Professor. Anne Marie Piper] (https://ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/). My research explores how accessibility is understood, valued, and put into practice by people and organizations. Through my research I hope to uncover gaps and suggest practical strategies to make organizations more inclusive for people of all ages and abilities.

Storyteller
======
I love uncovering the stories behind policies, technologies, and systems, and sharing them in ways that spark insight and change. 

Human 
======
Outside of research, I’m endlessly curious about people, culture, and the little ways in which we connect.
