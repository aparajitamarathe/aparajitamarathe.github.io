I’m a third-year PhD Candidate at UC Irvine, advised by [Dr. Anne Marie Piper](https://ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/). My research explores how accessibility is understood, valued, and put into practice by people and organizations. I am passionate about uncovering the human stories behind policies, technologies, and systems—and sharing them in ways that inspire insight and meaningful change.
