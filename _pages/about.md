I’m a third-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, exploring how organizations can become more inclusive for people with diverse abilities. My work bridges theory and practice, examining socio-technical systems through a justice-oriented lens to improve accessibility in real-world contexts. With experience spanning both academia and the tech industry, I aim to connect research insights with practical strategies that make organizations more equitable and inclusive.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
