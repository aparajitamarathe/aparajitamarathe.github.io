I’m a third-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, exploring how organizations can become more inclusive for people with diverse abilities. My work bridges theory and practice, examining socio-technical systems through a justice-oriented lens to improve accessibility in real-world contexts. With experience spanning both academia and the tech industry, I aim to connect research insights with practical strategies that make organizations more equitable and inclusive.
