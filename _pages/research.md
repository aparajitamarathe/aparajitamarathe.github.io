Ongoing Research

**Understanding Accessibility and Organizational Practice**

I am currently conducting an ethnographic study at a local non-profit organization to explore how accessibility is understood, negotiated, and implemented by various organizational members. 

Select Projects
======
**Technology Companies’ Narratives on AI for Accessibility**  [Under Review]

This project uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine how technology companies frame “AI for accessibility” in their public narratives. The study highlights how corporate language and communication influences the social realities and power dynamics surrounding AI and accessibility. Through this work, we encourage researchers, practioners and policy makers to reflect not just on how AI systems work, but also on whose interests they serve and what kinds of futures they create.

**Experiences of Blind and Low Vision Employees in the Tech Industry** [Read Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3757666)

This project examines how blind and low vision (BLV) employees experience and negotiate accessibility within major technology companies. The study reveals a persistent gap between corporate commitments to inclusion and the realities of everyday work, which we call the accessibility paradox—the tension between profit-driven priorities and efforts to hire and support disabled workers. By introducing the accessibility paradox, we challenge current trends in the tech industry around accessibility and offer recommendations for organizations that genuinely aim to be more inclusive, helping them navigate these tensions in a sustainable way.

**Digital Workplace Collaboration Tools** [Read Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3663547.3746332)

In this project, we investigated how blind and low vision (BLV) professionals use and experience mainstream digital collaboration platforms. Through a survey of 155 BLV users, we report ease of use and importance of 30 common workplace tools. We find that accessibility barriers often limit collaboration, job performance, and career advancement. We highlight how these gaps compound inequities in digital work and offer recommendations for designing more inclusive collaboration environments.
