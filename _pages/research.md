I'm a member of the [Accessibility Research Collective](https://accessibility.ics.uci.edu) at UC Irvine. As part of this, I have contributed to the [NSF Future of Work Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show-award/?AWD_ID=2326023) to study work practices and tools for blind and low vision workers.
