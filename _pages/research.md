* **Understanding Accessibility and Organizational Practice: **
I am currently conducting an ethnographic study at a local non-profit organization to explore how accessibility is understood, negotiated, and implemented by various organizational members.

======
* Technology Companies' Narratives on AI for Accessibility  [Under Review]
This project uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to examine how technology companies frame “AI for accessibility” in their public narratives. The study highlights how corporate language and communication influences the social realities and power dynamics surrounding AI and accessibility. We encourage researchers, practioners and policy makers to reflect not just on how AI systems work, but also on whose interests they serve and what kinds of futures they create.

* Examining Experiences of Blind and Low Vision Employees in the Tech Industry [Read Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3757666)
Many technology companies aim to improve access and inclusion not only by making their products accessible but also by bringing people with disabilities into the tech workforce. We know less about how accessibility is experienced and negotiated by disabled workers within these organizations. Through interviews with 20 BLV workers across various tech companies, we uncover a persistent misalignment between organizational attempts at accessibility and the current realities of these employees. We introduce the concept of the accessibility paradox, which we define as the inherent tension between the productivity- and profit-driven nature of tech companies and their desire to hire and retain disabled workers. Focusing on the experiences of BLV workers, we show how the accessibility paradox manifests in their everyday workplace interactions, including digital infrastructure, accommodations processes and policies, ability assumptions, and competing priorities. We offer recommendations for future research and practice to understand and improve workplace accessibility and inclusion.

* Understanding Ease of Use and Impacts of Digital Collaboration Tools for Blind and Low Vision Workers [Read Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3663547.3746332)
Real-time collaboration tools (e.g., videoconferencing or project management) are central to modern work but often pose significant
accessibility challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) people. While these tools can support both in-person and remote collaboration, barriers to usability and access can hinder full workforce participation. Prior research has explored accessibility issues with specific tools, but broader insights into how BLV people use and experience mainstream collaboration platforms remain limited. We conducted an online survey with 155 BLV users, evaluating the ease of using 30 widely used collaboration tools. Findings show that Zoom is rated as the easiest tool to use, however, project management and whiteboarding tools are rated relatively difficult to use. Over half of the respondents reported that accessibility barriers negatively impact their collaboration, job performance, and career growth. We discuss the compounding effects of inaccessible collaborative tools and offer design recommendations for more inclusive digital workspaces.
